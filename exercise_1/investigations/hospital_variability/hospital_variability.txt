where 
"variability_score" is the standard deviation of the scores for each procedure; 
"count_score" is the number of not NULL scores for each procedure;

Important note: as in the previous analysis, also in this case we removed from the procedures that are measured in time. 


To select the most variable procedures we fixed a threashold of 30 scores not NULL for procedure, to ommit from this analysis procedures with few scores. For example "AMI_7a  Fibrinolytic Therapy Received within 30 Minutes of Hospital Arrival" has only 3 not null scores in all the dataset and cannot be used for this analysis in order to avoid false conclusions.
